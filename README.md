# CleanWiki

CleanWiki is a chrome extension which provides a clean white theme for Wikipedia. Inspired by the 1911 theme and Wikiwand. It is cleaner and uses serif font to make the content look more academic.

I made this quick style when I saw Wikiwand had gone paid, and so it might be rough around the edges. I'll work on it from time to time, but community additions are welcome. Please contribute!
